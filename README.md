# Monk Commerce Coupons Management API
## Purpose

Monk Commerce Coupons Management API is a robust backend solution designed to efficiently handle the creation, management, and application of **discount coupons** in e-commerce platforms. The goal is to enable dynamic promotional strategies—such as cart-wise, product-wise, and Buy-X-Get-Y (BxGy) deals—while maintaining **scalability, extensibility, and correctness**. This backend empowers marketing teams and delights customers by ensuring discounts are reliably calculated and easily managed.
